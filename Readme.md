## Abstract

The aim of this project is to develop a web application to predict the outcome of a Formula 1 race using previous race results. It will utilise linear regression as the data mining prediction model using data from race weekends including practice, qualifying and race data covering the last four years. The web application will be hosted on Google App Engine and utilise the available Google toolkits and API’s. Sports science is a new and expanding field of research in many competitive sports and many teams are now choosing to utilise data mining techniques to improve different aspects of their game such as training, coaching, and selection of player’s as well as prediction. As there is no readily available F1 dataset, the dataset will be created from data available from the F1 governing body website along with data stored by Forix, a data collection website for motor racing. The data is collected, cleansed, sorted and analysed using Excel and visual basic code before been uploaded to Google cloud storage, where it can be accessed by the web application. The project will aim towards building a user community around the application with the development of a fantasy F1 style member’s league, news section and chat section. Clear tutorials will created for users to allow them to use the prediction model for F1 races.
